# üîß Catalog Debug Guide - "No Products Found" Issue

## üö® **Problem Analysis**

You're getting "üì¶ No products found" even though products exist in your database. This is likely due to **organization ID mismatch** between what the catalog service is looking for and what's actually in your database.

## üõ† **Debug Steps - Follow These in Order**

### **Step 1: Check What Products Actually Exist**

First, let's see what's in your database:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/debug/catalog/products
```

This will show:
- Total products in database
- Sample products with their `organization_id` values
- Count by organization ID

### **Step 2: Test Without Organization Filter**

Test if products can be found when we ignore organization filtering:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp/catalog/test-no-filter
```

If this shows products, then it's definitely an organization ID mismatch issue.

### **Step 3: Check Organization IDs**

See all unique organization IDs in your products table:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/debug/catalog/organizations
```

### **Step 4: Check Zoho Credentials Mapping**

Check what organization IDs are in your Zoho credentials table:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/debug/catalog/zoho-credentials
```

### **Step 5: Test Specific Organization ID**

If you found organization IDs from Step 3, test with a specific one:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp/catalog/quick?organizationId=YOUR_ACTUAL_ORG_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_ORG_ID` with a real ID from Step 3.

## üîç **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Empty Organization ID**
**Problem**: Products have `organization_id` but service is getting empty string or `default-org`

**Solution**: I've updated the code to fetch all active products when no valid organization ID is provided:

```typescript
// Updated logic in catalog service
if (options.organizationId && options.organizationId !== 'default-org' && options.organizationId.trim() !== '') {
  whereClause.organization_id = options.organizationId;
} else {
  // Skip organization filter - get all active products
  this.logger.warn(`No valid organizationId provided, fetching all active products`);
}
```

### **Issue 2: WhatsApp Context Missing Organization ID**
**Problem**: Conversation handler can't determine correct organization ID

**Solution**: Enhanced the conversation handler to lookup organization ID from distributor phone:

```typescript
// Try to get organization ID from context, fallback to DB lookup
let organizationId = context.distributorPhoneNumber;
if (!organizationId || organizationId === 'default-org') {
  organizationId = await this.getOrganizationId(context.distributorPhoneNumber || '');
}
```

### **Issue 3: Database Query Issues**
**Problem**: Prisma query not finding products due to case sensitivity or exact matching

**Solution**: Test the exact query being used:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/debug/catalog/test-query?organizationId=YOUR_ORG_ID
```

## üöÄ **Quick Fix Options**

### **Option 1: Test Without Organization Filter (Immediate)**

Try the quick catalog without organization filter:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp/catalog/quick
# (No organizationId parameter)
```

### **Option 2: Use First Organization ID from Database**

1. Get organization IDs: `GET /api/debug/catalog/organizations`
2. Use the first one: `GET /api/whatsapp/catalog/quick?organizationId=FIRST_ORG_ID`

### **Option 3: Test via WhatsApp**

In your WhatsApp conversation, type:
- `catalog` - Should show products if organization mapping is fixed
- `quick` - Should show top 5 products

## üìä **Debug Logging**

I've added extensive debug logging. Check your console for:

```
[DEBUG] getProducts called with options: { organizationId: "...", ... }
[DEBUG] Filtering by organization_id: YOUR_ORG_ID
[DEBUG] Final where clause: { organization_id: "...", status: "active" }
[DEBUG] Query results: X products found, Y total
```

## üîÑ **Testing Workflow**

1. **Start server**: `npm run start:dev`

2. **Test basic product existence**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/debug/catalog/products"
   ```

3. **Test without filters**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp/catalog/test-no-filter"
   ```

4. **Test with correct org ID**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp/catalog/quick?organizationId=REAL_ORG_ID"
   ```

5. **Test via WhatsApp**:
   Send "catalog" or "quick" to your WhatsApp bot

## üì± **WhatsApp Testing**

After fixing the organization ID issue, test these commands in WhatsApp:

- `catalog` - Full product catalog
- `quick` - Quick top 5 products
- `search cement` - Search for products
- `categories` - Browse by category
- `help catalog` - Show all available commands

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix:**
```
üì¶ No products found

Try adjusting your search or browse our categories.
```

### **After Fix:**
```
üõí Quick Catalog - Top Products

1. Portland Cement 50kg Bag
üí∞ ‚Çπ450 | ‚úÖ In Stock
üìã SKU: CEM-50KG-001

2. Steel TMT Bars 12mm
üí∞ ‚Çπ65,000 | ‚úÖ In Stock

üì± Type product name to place order
üìã Type 'catalog' to see full catalog
üîç Type 'search [keyword]' to find specific products
```

## üîß **Manual Database Check**

If you want to check your database directly:

```sql
-- Check total products
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE status = 'active';

-- Check organization IDs
SELECT organization_id, COUNT(*) as product_count
FROM products
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY organization_id;

-- Sample products
SELECT id, name, organization_id, status
FROM products
WHERE status = 'active'
LIMIT 5;
```

## üìû **Need Help?**

If none of these steps work:

1. **Check the debug endpoints** first
2. **Look at console logs** for the detailed debug output I added
3. **Share the results** from the debug endpoints

The issue is almost certainly an organization ID mismatch, and the debug endpoints will help identify exactly what's wrong! üîç
