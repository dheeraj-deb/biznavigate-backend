# AI-Powered Product Extraction Tests

## Overview
The bot now uses **AI (Gemini) + Rule-based fallback** to extract products and quantities from natural language messages.

---

## Test Cases

### ✅ Test 1: Standard Format "product x quantity"
**Input**: `"shirt x 1"`

**Expected AI Output**:
```json
{
  "intent": "place_order",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "extractedEntities": {
    "productName": "shirt",
    "quantity": 1,
    "products": [
      {"name": "shirt", "quantity": 1, "confidence": 0.95}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Expected Flow**:
- Event: `ORDER_PLACED`
- Next Step: `AWAITING_PRODUCT_LIST`
- Product matching starts

---

### ✅ Test 2: Natural Language "quantity product"
**Input**: `"10 shirts"`

**Expected AI Output**:
```json
{
  "intent": "place_order",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "extractedEntities": {
    "productName": "shirts",
    "quantity": 10,
    "products": [
      {"name": "shirts", "quantity": 10, "confidence": 0.95}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Expected Flow**:
- Event: `ORDER_PLACED`
- Extracts: product="shirts", qty=10

---

### ✅ Test 3: Multiple Products
**Input**: `"I need 5 cement bags and 20 steel rods"`

**Expected AI Output**:
```json
{
  "intent": "place_order",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "extractedEntities": {
    "productName": "cement bags",
    "quantity": 5,
    "products": [
      {"name": "cement bags", "quantity": 5, "confidence": 0.95},
      {"name": "steel rods", "quantity": 20, "confidence": 0.95}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Expected Flow**:
- Event: `ORDER_PLACED`
- Both products extracted and processed

---

### ✅ Test 4: With Extra Words
**Input**: `"100 bags of cement"`

**Expected AI Output**:
```json
{
  "intent": "place_order",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "extractedEntities": {
    "productName": "cement",
    "quantity": 100,
    "products": [
      {"name": "cement", "quantity": 100, "confidence": 0.95}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Rule-based Fallback** (if AI fails):
- Pattern 2: `/(\d+)\s+(?:bags?\s+(?:of\s+)?)?([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z\s]+?)/`
- Extracts: "100" and "cement"
- Removes "bags of" filler words

---

### ✅ Test 5: Search Without Quantity
**Input**: `"shirt"`

**Expected AI Output**:
```json
{
  "intent": "search_product",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "extractedEntities": {
    "productName": "shirt",
    "quantity": null,
    "products": [
      {"name": "shirt", "quantity": null, "confidence": 0.9}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Expected Flow**:
- Event: `null` (stays in PLACE_ORDER_REQUEST)
- Shows: "I see you're looking for 'shirt'..."

---

### ✅ Test 6: Polite Request
**Input**: `"Can I get 3 cement bags please"`

**Expected AI Output**:
```json
{
  "intent": "place_order",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "extractedEntities": {
    "productName": "cement bags",
    "quantity": 3,
    "products": [
      {"name": "cement bags", "quantity": 3, "confidence": 0.9}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Rule-based Fallback**:
- Pattern 3: `/(?:i\s+(?:need|want|require)\s+)?(\d+)\s+([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z\s]+)/`
- Still extracts correctly

---

### ✅ Test 7: Mixed Format List
**Input**: `"cement x 50, 100 steel rods"`

**Expected AI Output**:
```json
{
  "intent": "place_order",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "extractedEntities": {
    "products": [
      {"name": "cement", "quantity": 50, "confidence": 0.95},
      {"name": "steel rods", "quantity": 100, "confidence": 0.95}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Rule-based Fallback**:
- Pattern 1 catches: "cement x 50"
- Pattern 2 catches: "100 steel rods"

---

### ✅ Test 8: Common Misspellings (AI Advantage)
**Input**: `"cment x 100"` (typo)

**AI Behavior**:
- AI can understand context and spelling variations
- May still extract "cement" or at minimum recognize intent

**Rule-based Fallback**:
- Still extracts: `{name: "cment", quantity: 100}`
- Product matcher will handle fuzzy matching

---

## Rule-Based Patterns (Fallback)

### Pattern 1: "product x quantity"
```regex
/(.+?)\s*x\s*(\d+)/gi
```
**Matches**:
- ✅ "shirt x 1"
- ✅ "cement x 100"
- ✅ "SHIRT X 1" (case insensitive)
- ✅ "shirt x1" (flexible whitespace)

### Pattern 2: "quantity product"
```regex
/(\d+)\s+(?:bags?\s+(?:of\s+)?)?([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z\s]+?)(?:\s+and|\s*,|$)/gi
```
**Matches**:
- ✅ "10 shirts"
- ✅ "100 bags cement"
- ✅ "100 bags of cement"
- ✅ "50 steel rods"

### Pattern 3: "I need/want X product"
```regex
/(?:i\s+(?:need|want|require)\s+)?(\d+)\s+([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z\s]+)/gi
```
**Matches**:
- ✅ "I need 5 cement bags"
- ✅ "I want 10 shirts"
- ✅ "5 cement bags" (works without "I need")

## Logging Output

When you send `"shirt x 1"`, you should see:

```
[AI INTENT] Detected: place_order (confidence: 0.98)
[AI INTENT] Reasoning: User specified product with quantity
[AI INTENT] Extracted products: [{"name":"shirt","quantity":1,"confidence":0.95}]
[DEBUG] AI detected ORDER intent with high confidence - treating as ORDER_PLACED

========== TRANSITION ==========
PLACE_ORDER_REQUEST --[ORDER_PLACED]--> AWAITING_PRODUCT_LIST
================================

[UPDATE CONTEXT] Event: ORDER_PLACED, Body: "shirt x 1"
[UPDATE CONTEXT] Processing product list from ORDER_PLACED
[DEBUG] Organization ID: xxx
[DEBUG] Parsed products: [...]
```

## Advantages of AI + Rules Hybrid

### AI (Gemini) Advantages:
✅ **Natural Language**: Understands "I need 5 bags" vs "5 bags"
✅ **Context Awareness**: Better at ambiguous cases
✅ **Multi-product**: Excellent at parsing "X and Y"
✅ **Spelling Tolerance**: Can handle typos
✅ **Learning**: Gets better with more examples

### Rule-based Advantages:
✅ **Fast**: No API latency
✅ **Reliable**: Deterministic results
✅ **No Dependencies**: Works without internet/API key
✅ **Predictable**: Same input = same output
✅ **Privacy**: No data sent to external services

### Combined Benefits:
- **AI First**: Try AI for best accuracy
- **Rules Fallback**: Guaranteed extraction for standard formats
- **Confidence Threshold**: Only use AI if confidence > 0.7
- **Dual Validation**: AI result validated by rule patterns

## Testing Checklist

### Manual WhatsApp Testing:
- [ ] Send "hi" → Start conversation
- [ ] Wait for "Ready to take your order!"
- [ ] Send "shirt x 1" → Should proceed to order
- [ ] Send "10 shirts" → Should proceed to order
- [ ] Send "I need 5 cement bags" → Should proceed to order
- [ ] Send "shirt" (no qty) → Should show search suggestion
- [ ] Send "cement x 50, 100 steel" → Should extract both

### Check Logs:
```bash
# AI detection logs
grep "AI INTENT" logs/app.log | tail -20

# Product extraction
grep "Extracted products" logs/app.log | tail -10

# State transitions
grep "TRANSITION" logs/app.log | tail -10
```

### Verify Redis Cache:
```bash
redis-cli
> KEYS intent:*
> GET intent:[base64_encoded_message]
# Should show cached intent results
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI not extracting products
**Check**:
1. GEMINI_API_KEY is set
2. Check AI response in logs
3. Verify JSON parsing didn't fail
4. Rule-based fallback should still work

### Issue: Rule-based patterns not matching
**Check**:
1. Verify regex patterns in logs
2. Test patterns in regex tester
3. Check for special characters in input
4. Ensure input isn't being modified before parsing

### Issue: Both AI and Rules fail
**Possible causes**:
1. Input is truly ambiguous (e.g., "hello")
2. Intent is not ORDER or SEARCH
3. Check if catalog commands are intercepting

## Success Metrics

✅ **"shirt x 1"** → Extracts: {name: "shirt", qty: 1}
✅ **"10 shirts"** → Extracts: {name: "shirts", qty: 10}
✅ **"100 bags cement"** → Extracts: {name: "cement", qty: 100}
✅ **"I need 5 steel rods"** → Extracts: {name: "steel rods", qty: 5}
✅ **"cement x 50, 100 steel"** → Extracts both products
✅ **"shirt"** → Detects search intent (no qty)
✅ Works with or without GEMINI_API_KEY
✅ < 500ms response time with cache
✅ 95%+ accuracy on standard formats

---

## Next Steps

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Voice Messages**: Integrate speech-to-text + AI extraction
2. **Image Orders**: OCR from photos of orders
3. **Context Memory**: Remember previous orders for "same as last time"
4. **Auto-correction**: "Did you mean 'cement' instead of 'cment'?"
5. **Quantity Validation**: "100000 shirts seems high, did you mean 100?"
